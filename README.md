# üèãÔ∏è Workout Split App

A mobile app that helps users **create, organize, and track workout splits**.  
Built with **Expo (React Native)** and **Supabase** for cross-platform fitness tracking.  

---

## üìñ How the App Currently Functions

### Core Functionality
- **Workout Splits:** Create and organize workout splits using either weekly or rotation scheduling.
- **Workout Days:** Build custom workout days (e.g., "Upper A", "Legs 1") and assign exercises.
- **Today Tab:**
  - Select any date using the calendar picker (historical tracking is fully supported).
  - Log bodyweight for the selected date.
  - View and complete the scheduled workout for the selected date.
  - Log sets, reps, weight, and notes for each exercise.
  - Mark workout as complete or rest.
- **Workout Logging:** All workout and bodyweight logs are tied to the selected calendar date, not just the current day.
- **History:** View past workouts and bodyweight logs by selecting previous dates.

### Tracking & Insights
- Bodyweight logging and trends.
- Workout history viewer (by date).
- Personal records and achievements (basic, more planned).

### UI/UX
- Modernized modals and input styling for splits, days, and bodyweight.
- Calendar picker with correct timezone handling.
- Consistent input and checkbox behavior across all logging screens.

### Technical Notes
- All historical data is now correctly tracked by the date the user selects, not the date the entry was created.
- Database schema supports both audit (created_at) and semantic (logged_for/date) dates for all logs.

## üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap

### Phase 1 ‚Äî Foundations
**Set up Repo & Environment**
- Create a GitHub repo.  
- Initialize Expo project (expo init with TypeScript template).  
- Configure ESLint + Prettier.  
- Install dependencies:  
  - `@react-navigation/*` (tab + stack navigation).  
  - `@tanstack/react-query` or `zustand`.  
  - `supabase-js`.  

**Set Up Supabase Backend**
- Create Supabase project.  
- Define tables:  
  - `days` (workout day templates)  
  - `splits` (week or rotation)  
  - `workouts` (logged sessions)  
  - `exercises` (per workout day)  
  - `logs` (sets/reps/weights per exercise)  
  - `bodyweight` (daily log).  
- Enable Row Level Security (RLS).  
- Write policies so users only access their own data.  

**Authentication**
- Add Supabase Auth (email/password login + signup).  
- On login, fetch profile and store in global state.  
- Set up auto-login (check stored Supabase session on app start).  

‚úÖ At this point: You can log in, log out, and have your account tied to Supabase.
